# Movie Picker
My friends and I have a semi-weekly movie night. This is a little website as a fun way to vote on what movie to watch next week

# How to run locally
* clone the project
* run `yarn install`
* run `yarn dev`
* website is now running at `localhost:5173`. You'll need to get a TMDB API key and copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the APi key before it'll be useful, though.
